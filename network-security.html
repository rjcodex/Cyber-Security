            <h1>Key Concepts in Network Security</h1>
            <br>
            
            <p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals. Techniques like encryption, access controls, and secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS) are used to protect data from unauthorized access and eavesdropping.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Integrity:</b> Ensures that information is accurate and has not been tampered with. Techniques like hashing and digital signatures help detect alterations or corruption in data, ensuring that it remains trustworthy. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Availability:</b> Ensures that data and network resources are available to authorized users when needed. This involves protecting against disruptions like Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, ensuring redundancy, and implementing disaster recovery plans. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Authentication:</b> Confirms the identity of users or devices before granting access to network resources. Methods include passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). <br>
                <br>
                <b>Authorization:</b> Defines what resources and information users can access based on their identity. Access control lists (ACLs), role-based access control (RBAC), and least privilege principles are commonly used to enforce authorization. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Accountability:</b> Tracks and logs user activities to ensure that actions can be attributed to specific individuals. This helps in auditing and investigating incidents and maintaining user accountability. <br>
                <br>

            <h1>Types of Network Security</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Physical Security:</b> Protects the hardware and physical infrastructure of the network. This includes securing data centers, servers, and network devices against physical threats such as theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Perimeter Security:</b> Involves defending the boundary of the network to prevent unauthorized access. Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and demilitarized zones (DMZs) are typical perimeter defenses. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Endpoint Security:</b> Focuses on securing end-user devices (e.g., computers, smartphones) that connect to the network. Anti-malware software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and mobile device management (MDM) systems are used to secure endpoints. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Network Access Control (NAC):</b> Manages how devices gain access to the network. It verifies the security posture of devices before they are allowed to connect and imposes security policies to control access. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Data Security:</b> Protects data in transit across the network and data at rest within storage systems. Encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), and secure data destruction are crucial data security practices. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Cloud Security:</b> Addresses the unique security challenges of cloud environments. This includes securing cloud platforms, managing data security in cloud storage, and ensuring compliance with security policies in a multi-cloud environment. <br>
